### Building

clone
`git clone https://github.com/ninabreznik/service.js.git`

change directory
`cd service`

install dependencies
`npm install`

### Running

Currently you can only run the scenarios, stored in /lab folder.

To run other scenarios, run `node lab/scenarios/*`, for example `node lab/scenarios/service-mvp.js`
and so on.

We are using scenarios to debug the flow. Current scenarios are working only with the chain simulation.
